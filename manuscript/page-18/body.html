<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Hawkeye calls the Lac du Saint Sacrement, the &ldquo;Horican.&rdquo; As we believe this to be an appropriation of the name that has its origin with ourselves, the time has arrived, perhaps, when the fact should be frankly admitted. While writing this book, fully a quarter of a century since, it occurred to us that the French name of this lake was too complicated, the American too commonplace, and the Indian too unpronounceable, for either to be used familiarly in a work of fiction. Looking over an ancient map, it was ascertained that a tribe of Indians, called &ldquo;Les Horicans&rdquo; by the French, existed in the neighborhood of this beautiful sheet of water. As every word uttered by Natty Bumppo was not to be received as rigid truth, we took the liberty of putting the &ldquo;Horican&rdquo; into his mouth, as the substitute for &ldquo;Lake George.</p></div> </div>
