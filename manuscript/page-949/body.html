It is much used also by the whites. By corn is meant maise.</p><p>&ldquo;He is come,&rdquo; repeated Magua, bending his head with the dignity of an eastern prince.</p><p>The chief extended his arm and taking the other by the wrist, they once more exchanged friendly salutations. Then the Delaware invited his guest to enter his own lodge, and share his morning meal. The invitation was accepted; and the two warriors, attended by three or four of the old men, walked calmly away, leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a desire to understand the reasons of so unusual a visit, and yet not betraying the least impatience by sign or word.</p></div> </div>
