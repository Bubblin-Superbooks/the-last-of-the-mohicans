I only wonder he has escaped with life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is he not dead?&rdquo; demanded Cora, in a voice whose husky tones showed how powerfully natural horror struggled with her assumed firmness. &ldquo;Can we do aught to assist the wretched man?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no! the life is in his heart yet, and after he has slept awhile he will come to himself, and be a wiser man for it, till the hour of his real time shall come,&rdquo; returned Hawkeye, casting another oblique glance at the insensible body, while he filled his charger with admirable nicety. &ldquo;Carry him in, Uncas, and lay him on the sassafras.
