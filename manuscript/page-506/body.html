I trust, monsieur, you come authorized to treat for the surrender of the place?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Has your excellency found our defense so feeble as to believe the measure necessary?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should be sorry to have the defense protracted in such a manner as to irritate my red friends there,&rdquo; continued Montcalm, glancing his eyes at the group of grave and attentive Indians, without attending to the other's questions; &ldquo;I find it difficult, even now, to limit them to the usages of war.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
