<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Book!&rdquo; repeated Hawkeye, with singular and ill-concealed disdain; &ldquo;do you take me for a whimpering boy at the apronstring of one of your old gals; and this good rifle on my knee for the feather of a goose's wing, my ox's horn for a bottle of ink, and my leathern pouch for a cross-barred handkercher to carry my dinner? Book! what have such as I, who am a warrior of the wilderness, though a man without a cross, to do with books? I never read but in one, and the words that are written there are too simple and too plain to need much schooling; though I may boast that of forty long and hard-working years.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
