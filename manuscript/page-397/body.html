The scout laughed in his silent but heartfelt manner, and shook his head with vast satisfaction.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! you want the flavor that one gets by habit; the time was when I liked it as little as yourself; but I have come to my taste, and I now crave it, as a deer does the licks*. Your high-spiced wines are not better liked than a red-skin relishes this water; especially when his natur' is ailing. But Uncas has made his fire, and it is time we think of eating, for our journey is long, and all before us.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
