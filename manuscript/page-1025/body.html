Tamenund held him long at the length of his arm and read every turn in the fine lineaments of his countenance, with the untiring gaze of one who recalled days of happiness.</p><p>&ldquo;Is Tamenund a boy?&rdquo; at length the bewildered prophet exclaimed. &ldquo;Have I dreamed of so many snows&mdash;that my people were scattered like floating sands&mdash;of Yengeese, more plenty than the leaves on the trees! The arrow of Tamenund would not frighten the fawn; his arm is withered like the branch of a dead oak; the snail would be swifter in the race; yet is Uncas before him as they went to battle against the pale faces!
