<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In this stage of the obsequies, a warrior much renowned for deed in arms, and more especially for services in the recent combat, a man of stern and grave demeanor, advanced slowly from the crowd, and placed himself nigh the person of the dead.</p><p>&ldquo;Why hast thou left us, pride of the Wapanachki?&rdquo; he said, addressing himself to the dull ears of Uncas, as if the empty clay retained the faculties of the animated man; &ldquo;thy time has been like that of the sun when in the trees; thy glory brighter than his light at noonday.
