Seat yourselves in the shade which the moon throws from yonder beech&mdash;'tis thicker than that of the pines&mdash;and let us wait for that which the Lord may choose to send next. Let all your conversation be in whispers; though it would be better, and, perhaps, in the end, wiser, if each one held discourse with his own thoughts, for a time.&rdquo;</p><p>The manner of the scout was seriously impressive, though no longer distinguished by any signs of unmanly apprehension.</p></div> </div>
