<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Can the pale face beat it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Huron!&rdquo; exclaimed the scout, raising the short rifle in his right hand, and shaking it at Magua, with as much apparent ease as if it were a reed; &ldquo;yes, Huron, I could strike you now, and no power on earth could prevent the deed! The soaring hawk is not more certain of the dove than I am this moment of you, did I choose to send a bullet to your heart! Why should I not? Why!&mdash;because the gifts of my color forbid it, and I might draw down evil on tender and innocent heads. If you know such a being as God, thank Him, therefore, in your inward soul; for you have reason!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
