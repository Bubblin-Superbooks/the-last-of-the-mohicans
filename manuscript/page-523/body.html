<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Heaven protect me from a prejudice so unworthy of my reason!&rdquo; returned Duncan, at the same time conscious of such a feeling, and that as deeply rooted as if it had been ingrafted in his nature. &ldquo;The sweetness, the beauty, the witchery of your younger daughter, Colonel Munro, might explain my motives without imputing to me this injustice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ye are right, sir,&rdquo; returned the old man, again changing his tones to those of gentleness, or rather softness; &ldquo;the girl is the image of what her mother was at her years, and before she had become acquainted with grief. When death deprived me of my wife I returned to Scotland, enriched by the marriage; and, would you think it, Duncan! the suffering angel had remained in the heartless state of celibacy twenty long years, and that for the sake of a man who could forget her! She did more, sir; she overlooked my want of faith, and, all difficulties being now removed, she took me for her husband.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
