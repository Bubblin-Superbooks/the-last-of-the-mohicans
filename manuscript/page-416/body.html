<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The eyes of a white man are too heavy and too blind for such a watch as this! The Mohican will be our sentinel, therefore let us sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I proved myself a sluggard on my post during the past night,&rdquo; said Heyward, &ldquo;and have less need of repose than you, who did more credit to the character of a soldier. Let all the party seek their rest, then, while I hold the guard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If we lay among the white tents of the Sixtieth, and in front of an enemy like the French, I could not ask for a better watchman,&rdquo; returned the scout; &ldquo;but in the darkness and among the signs of the wilderness your judgment would be like the folly of a child, and your vigilance thrown away. Do then, like Uncas and myself, sleep, and sleep in safety.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
