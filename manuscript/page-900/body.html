<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The Hurons are boasters,&rdquo; said Uncas, scornfully; &ldquo;their 'totem' is a moose, and they run like snails. The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ay, lad, there is truth in what you say; and I doubt not, on a rush, you would pass the whole nation; and, in a straight race of two miles, would be in, and get your breath again, afore a knave of them all was within hearing of the other village. But the gift of a white man lies more in his arms than in his legs. As for myself, I can brain a Huron as well as a better man; but when it comes to a race the knaves would prove too much for me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
