<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Eleven warriors lie hid from the graves of their tribes since the snows have melted, and none will tell where to find them when the tongue of Chingachgook shall be silent! Let them draw the sharpest knife, and whirl the swiftest tomahawk, for their bitterest enemy is in their hands. Uncas, topmost branch of a noble trunk, call on the cowards to hasten, or their hearts will soften, and they will change to women!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They look among the fishes for their dead!&rdquo; returned the low, soft voice of the youthful chieftain; &ldquo;the Hurons float with the slimy eels! They drop from the oaks like fruit that is ready to be eaten! and the Delawares laugh!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
