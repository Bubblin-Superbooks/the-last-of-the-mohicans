In this manner, rocks, precipices and difficulties were surmounted in an incredibly short space, that at another time, and under other circumstances, would have been deemed almost insuperable. But the impetuous young men were rewarded by finding that, encumbered with Cora, the Hurons were losing ground in the race.</p><p>&ldquo;Stay, dog of the Wyandots!&rdquo; exclaimed Uncas, shaking his bright tomahawk at Magua; &ldquo;a Delaware girl calls stay!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will go no further!&rdquo; cried Cora, stopping unexpectedly on a ledge of rock, that overhung a deep precipice, at no great distance from the summit of the mountain. &ldquo;Kill me if thou wilt, detestable Huron; I will go no further.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
