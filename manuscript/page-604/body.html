Montcalm!&rdquo; continued the deeply resentful and less self-restrained scout; &ldquo;they say a time must come when all the deeds done in the flesh will be seen at a single look; and that by eyes cleared from mortal infirmities. Woe betide the wretch who is born to behold this plain, with the judgment hanging about his soul!
