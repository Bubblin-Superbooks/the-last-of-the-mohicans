When he is seen above the trees, there will be men on your trail.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hear a crow!&rdquo; exclaimed Magua, with a taunting laugh. &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; he added, shaking his hand at the crowd, which had slowly opened to admit his passage. &ldquo;Where are the petticoats of the Delawares! Let them send their arrows and their guns to the Wyandots; they shall have venison to eat, and corn to hoe. Dogs, rabbits, thieves&mdash;I spit on you!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
