<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;we have journeyed far, and few among us are blessed with forms like that of yours, which seems to know neither fatigue nor weakness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The sinews and bones of a man carry me through it all,&rdquo; said the hunter, surveying his muscular limbs with a simplicity that betrayed the honest pleasure the compliment afforded him; &ldquo;there are larger and heavier men to be found in the settlements, but you might travel many days in a city before you could meet one able to walk fifty miles without stopping to take breath, or who has kept the hounds within hearing during a chase of hours. However, as flesh and blood are not always the same, it is quite reasonable to suppose that the gentle ones are willing to rest, after all they have seen and done this day.</p></div> </div>
