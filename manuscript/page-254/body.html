After waiting a short time, Cora pointed down the river, and said:</p><p>&ldquo;Your friends have not been seen, and are now, most probably, in safety. Is it not time for you to follow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uncas will stay,&rdquo; the young Mohican calmly answered in English.</p><p>&ldquo;To increase the horror of our capture, and to diminish the chances of our release! Go, generous young man,&rdquo; Cora continued, lowering her eyes under the gaze of the Mohican, and perhaps, with an intuitive consciousness of her power; &ldquo;go to my father, as I have said, and be the most confidential of my messengers. Tell him to trust you with the means to buy the freedom of his daughters. Go! 'tis my wish, 'tis my prayer, that you will go!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
