<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Go; I am a man, and I will enter the rock and fight the wicked one.&rdquo;</p><p>Heyward had gladly obeyed, and was already past the little group, when these startling words arrested him.</p><p>&ldquo;Is my brother mad?&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;is he cruel? He will meet the disease, and it will enter him; or he will drive out the disease, and it will chase his daughter into the woods. No; let my children wait without, and if the spirit appears beat him down with clubs. He is cunning, and will bury himself in the mountain, when he sees how many are ready to fight him.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
