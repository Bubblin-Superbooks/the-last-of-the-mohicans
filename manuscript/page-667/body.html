<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;That's a trail that nothing but a nose can follow,&rdquo; said the satisfied scout, looking back along their difficult way; &ldquo;grass is a treacherous carpet for a flying party to tread on, but wood and stone take no print from a moccasin. Had you worn your armed boots, there might, indeed, have been something to fear; but with the deer-skin suitably prepared, a man may trust himself, generally, on rocks with safety. Shove in the canoe nigher to the land, Uncas; this sand will take a stamp as easily as the butter of the Jarmans on the Mohawk. Softly, lad, softly; it must not touch the beach, or the knaves will know by what road we have left the place.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
