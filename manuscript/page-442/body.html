These eyes have seen its waters colored with blood, as natural water never yet flowed from the bowels of the 'arth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was a convenient, and, I trust, will prove a peaceful grave for a soldier. You have then seen much service on this frontier?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; said the scout, erecting his tall person with an air of military pride; &ldquo;there are not many echoes among these hills that haven't rung with the crack of my rifle, nor is there the space of a square mile atwixt Horican and the river, that 'killdeer' hasn't dropped a living body on, be it an enemy or be it a brute beast. As for the grave there being as quiet as you mention, it is another matter.</p></div> </div>
