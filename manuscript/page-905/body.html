<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My pursuits are peaceful, and my temper, I humbly trust, is greatly given to mercy and love,&rdquo; returned David, a little nettled at so direct an attack on his manhood; &ldquo;but there are none who can say that I have ever forgotten my faith in the Lord, even in the greatest straits.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your chiefest danger will be at the moment when the savages find out that they have been deceived. If you are not then knocked on the head, your being a non-composser will protect you; and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed. If you stay, it must be to sit down here in the shadow, and take the part of Uncas, until such times as the cunning of the Indians discover the cheat, when, as I have already said, your times of trial will come. So choose for yourself&mdash;to make a rush or tarry here.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
